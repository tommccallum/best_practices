Have a clear articulated plan for what you are going to search for.  Restrict initial search to last 3-5 years.  
For contrasting views you can research back further on points of depth.

# Literature Review

Per paragraph have the following structure:
* introduce topic, or join to previous using linkage "similar to", "according to", "in contrast"
* Cite research, ensure you have multiple sources.  Even if the sources are backing up the same point and not opposing.
* beware trying to cover too much if you have a word limit

## Conclusion

* Draw out the key points and the main takeaways
* Identify a couple of points of further work that would build on the work cited
