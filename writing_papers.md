# Writing papers

(Notes from SICSA PhD Conference 2019 Workshop)

Process to follow is:
1. Write an outline of the paper first
2. Do research
3. Write up results
4. Go to 2

The process of writing will help focus your ideas.

(Taken from Prof Simon Peyton Jones - reference below)
* Once you have an idea, start writing right away
* Identify what your contributions will be at the beginning of the writing process. This list can be updated as you go
* Be engaging and grab the reader in
* Save related works for the end
* Use plenty of examples as evidence
* The majority of the paper should be the details (results/analysis)
* A reviewer should come away knowing exactly what the 1 main idea/contribution was
* Give credit instead of tearing down other similar works and identify your weaknesses in the paper
* Always listen carefully to criticisms
* Have 1-2 people read each draft of your paper, being sure to have them tell you where they got lost

# Conferences

* Check out previous years papers and look for common trends such as reference quality, layout, number of equations, quality of writing.
* Use phrases such as "competes strongly with" if not beating all metrics, find area where it is novel or best
* Stress novelty/importance/relevance clearly in abstract
* Be authoritative in what the relevance is - don't be humble!
* Meet word count or this will be straight reject.
* Match which person the papers are written in (I, we, one)
* Get friends and peers to review paper first to catch unclear sentences, spelling mistakes, obvious errors.
* Understand the ranking of the conference and acceptance rate - start high and then work down.
* Look at feedback as constructive and not negative
* Check your own references for where they were published, that might be a good indicator to where you should publish
* What is the impact factor of the conference?
* More for ongoing work
* A conference paper should have 1 idea only

# Journals

* Turn around time is months
* 30% difference between conference paper and journal entry, must have some extension from the conference paper
* acceptance rate is 15-25%
* More for finished work
