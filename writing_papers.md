# Writing papers and getting published

(Notes from SICSA PhD Conference 2019 Workshop)

Process to follow is:
1. Write an outline of the paper first
2. Do research
3. Write up results
4. Go to 2

The process of writing will help focus your ideas.

* Decide what kind of paper you are writing:
  * a benchmark beating paper
  * introducing a new idea paper
  * a literature review paper to establish baseline
  * a meta-review to establish new result
* Find papers from conferences you want to get into that match the style of your research - what have they done that makes their paper stand out.

(Taken from Prof Simon Peyton Jones - reference below)
* Once you have an idea, start writing right away
* Identify what your contributions will be at the beginning of the writing process. This list can be updated as you go
* Be engaging and grab the reader in
* Save related works for the end
* Use plenty of examples as evidence
* The majority of the paper should be the details (results/analysis)
* A reviewer should come away knowing exactly what the 1 main idea/contribution was
* Give credit instead of tearing down other similar works and identify your weaknesses in the paper
* Always listen carefully to criticisms
* Have 1-2 people read each draft of your paper, being sure to have them tell you where they got lost

# Conferences

* Check out previous years papers and look for common trends such as reference quality, layout, number of equations, quality of writing.
* Use phrases such as "competes strongly with" if not beating all metrics, find area where it is novel or best
* Stress novelty/importance/relevance clearly in abstract
* Be authoritative in what the relevance is - don't be humble!
* Meet word count or this will be straight reject.
* Match which person the papers are written in (I, we, one)
* Get friends and peers to review paper first to catch unclear sentences, spelling mistakes, obvious errors.
* Understand the ranking of the conference and acceptance rate - start high and then work down.
* Look at feedback as constructive and not negative
* Check your own references for where they were published, that might be a good indicator to where you should publish
* What is the impact factor of the conference?
* More for ongoing work
* A conference paper should have 1 idea only

## Guide to Sections

These are rough sections that all templates normally require.  Will differ depending on topic area so look at similar conferences.

* Title
This should be your research question and should articulate the question you are trying to answer.
* Abstract
* Keywords
* Introduction
This should be the first section you write BEFORE you begin your research.
  * Why is this an interesting question? 
  * What is the current state of the field?
  * What is your contribution?  The contribution of this paper is...
  * Forward reference to other sections to explain what the reader can find where
* Methodology
  * Context
  * Participants
  * Data Collection Method
  * Analytic Approach
* Results
* Discussion
  * Critical analysis of the results
  * How does it fit in with existing work? Does it agree/disagree?
  * References should be made to the work that this builds on
* Conclusion
  * Here you should be drawing the strands of the discussion, restate your aims and reiterating your contribution.
  * State what the limitations were 
  * State how this could be extended in the future / additional research (you may need references here)
* Related Work
* Acknowledgements
  * Thank funders 
  * Thank collaborators and people who have guided your work.
  * Thank any anonymous reviewers for their feedback.
  * Thank those who participated in the research.
* References
  * Prefer journal papers and good quality conference proceedings 
  
# Journals

* Turn around time is months
* 30% difference between conference paper and journal entry, must have some extension from the conference paper
* acceptance rate is 15-25%
* More for finished work
